# LendingCaseStudy

**Problem Statement**

---



You work for a consumer finance company specializing "Lending Club", in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, it faces a crucial decision: whether or not to approve the loan based on the applicant's profile. The decision is influenced by two main risks:

1.   Risk of Losing Business (False Negative): If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, but the loan is not approved, the company misses out on potential revenue and profit

2.  Risk of Financial Loss (False Positive): If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan (i.e., likely to default), and the loan is approved, the company may suffer a financial loss due to non-repayment.

Given the data on past loan applicants, which includes information about whether they defaulted on their loans or not, the task is to identify patterns in consumer and loan attributes that can predict whether a new applicant is likely to default. The goal is to leverage these insights for informed decision-making in loan approval. This can lead to actions such as:

Denying the loan to applicants with a high likelihood of defaulting.
Reducing the loan amount for high-risk individuals.
Offering loans to risky applicants but at a higher interest rate to offset potential risks.
In this case study, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be used to analyze the data and understand the relationship between various consumer attributes (e.g., income, credit history, employment) and loan attributes (e.g., loan amount, loan term) with the tendency to default. This insight will enable the company to better predict the likelihood of default and make more informed, risk-aware lending decisions.
